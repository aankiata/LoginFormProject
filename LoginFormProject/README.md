# Responsive Login Form

This project is a simple **Login Form** built using only **HTML & CSS**.  
It demonstrates:

- A clean, modern card-style login UI.

## Features
- Fixed width card (350px) with padding and border.
- Vertically & horizontally centered on screen.
- Labeled email and password fields.
- Full-width submit button.
- Subtle background, rounded corners, and box shadow.
